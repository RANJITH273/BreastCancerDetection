# Breast Cancer Classification Model

This project is focused on developing a predictive model for classifying breast cancer cases as benign or malignant. Leveraging machine learning techniques and historical data, we aim to provide a reliable tool to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.

## Description

Breast cancer is a critical healthcare concern. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can assist medical professionals in the diagnosis of breast cancer based on relevant features extracted from patient data and mammogram images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


jupyter notebook breast_cancer_classification.ipynb

## Usage
In the Jupyter Notebook, follow the step-by-step guide to train the breast cancer classification model. You can customize hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank the University of Wisconsin Hospitals for providing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which has been instrumental in this research and Kaggle.
