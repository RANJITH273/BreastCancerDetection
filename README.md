# Breast Cancer Classification Model

This project is focused on developing a predictive model for classifying breast cancer cases as benign or malignant. Leveraging machine learning techniques and historical data, we aim to provide a reliable tool to assist medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer.

## Description

Breast cancer is a critical healthcare concern. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for timely treatment. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can assist medical professionals in the diagnosis of breast cancer based on relevant features extracted from patient data and mammogram images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

1. You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


2. Installation : 

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash```

git clone https://github.com/RANJITH273/BreastCancerDetection/blob/c58db5a7c73f0dfed888e5527335bca7b692d4de/BreastCancerPrediction.ipynb
```bash```


3. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash```

cd breast-cancer-classification

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook to explore and run the project:

```bash```

jupyter notebook breast_cancer_classification.ipynb

## Usage
In the Jupyter Notebook, follow the step-by-step guide to train the breast cancer classification model. You can customize hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank the University of Wisconsin Hospitals for providing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which has been instrumental in this research and Kaggle.
